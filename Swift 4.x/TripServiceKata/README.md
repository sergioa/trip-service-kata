A Swift 4 port of the Trip Service Kata.

## Requirements
- Swift 4
- Xcode 9.1 (if you want to work with Xcode)

You can build the package on the command line with `swift build`.  
You can build the package and run the tests with `swift test`.

The Xcode project file is just included for convenience.  
It can be recreated at any time with `swift package generate-xcodeproj`.
